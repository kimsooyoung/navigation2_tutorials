Tutorial code referenced in https://navigation.ros.org/

This Repo Contains Custom Nav2 Plugins introduced in [Nav2 documents](https://navigation.ros.org/plugin_tutorials/index.html).

But original version only supports brand-new ROS 2 Galactic ver.

So I fixed few complie issues and make it usable for ROS 2 Foxy/Eloquent Versions.

Feel free to use it. & Tell me about more issue.
